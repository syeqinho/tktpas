# How to properly create a plugin

## Beginning 
Create a folder with the name of your plugin. In this folder, create a file named info.json

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66573599/146775438-070bc792-e820-474b-93ff-767ea01ccfc7.png)

And write in this file your configuration, example:
```json
{
	"github":"Stanley-GF", 
	"description":"Funny plugin allowing you to rickroll your victims", 
	"title":"Rickroll", 
  "features":["Show Rickroll Popup", "Open Never Gonna Give You Up on click", "Open Never Gonna Give you up in browser x times."],
	"discord_id":"9999999999999", 
	"telegram":"stanleygf"
}
```
Required fields are: `title`,`description`
Note: If you do not put your github name in `github`, owner name will be `Anonymous`

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Not required
Create a file named settings.json, here, you'll have to put your settings, example
```json
{

  "Number Of Rickroll":"%NOR%"
  
}
```
`Number Of Rickroll` is the parameter name and `%NOR%` will be the string replaced. Please use the same name in injection & in injector. 

## Injection ([/src/Injection](https://github.com/Stanley-GF/PirateStealer/tree/main/src/injection))
### :warning: *Injection is the part of the grabber that will be injected in the discord client*
Create a file named injection.js

In this file, put your injection code. then save it. Please note that if the injection code is obfuscated, we'll deny your plugin.

Save your file in the same directory of the info.json.

## Injector ([/src/Injector](https://github.com/Stanley-GF/PirateStealer/tree/main/src/injector))
### :warning: *injector is the part of the grabber that will inject the code in the discord client*

Still in the same directory, create a file named injector.js and write your code in. Please note that the injection link will be changed by staff.
